      <p>The design of the Eiffel Tower is attributed to Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, two senior engineers
        working
        for the Compagnie des Établissements Eiffel. It was envisioned after discussion about a suitable centrepiece
        for
        the proposed 1889 Exposition Universelle, a world's fair to celebrate the centennial of the French Revolution.
        Eiffel openly acknowledged that inspiration for a tower came from the Latting Observatory built in New York
        City
        in 1853.[4] In May 1884, working at home, Koechlin made a sketch of their idea, described by him as "a great
        pylon, consisting of four lattice girders standing apart at the base and coming together at the top, joined
        together by metal trusses at regular intervals".[5] Eiffel initially showed little enthusiasm, but he did
        approve
        further study, and the two engineers then asked Stephen Sauvestre, the head of company's architectural
        department,
        to contribute to the design. Sauvestre added decorative arches to the base of the tower, a glass pavilion to
        the
        first level, and other embellishments.</p>
      <p>Constructed from 1887 to 1889 as the entrance to the 1889 World's Fair, it was initially criticised by some
        of
        France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France
        and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[3] The Eiffel Tower is the most-visited paid
        monument
        in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.</p>
      <p>The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the tallest
        structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction,
        the
        Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title
        it
        held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first
        structure
        to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in 1957,
        it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is
        the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>
      <p>The new version gained Eiffel's support: he bought the rights to the patent on the design which Koechlin,
        Nougier, and Sauvestre had taken out, and the design was exhibited at the Exhibition of Decorative Arts in the
        autumn of 1884 under the company name. On 30 March 1885, Eiffel presented his plans to the Société des
        Ingénieurs Civils; after discussing the technical problems and emphasising the practical uses of the tower, he
        finished his talk by saying the tower would symbolise</p>
